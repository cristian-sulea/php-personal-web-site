<p>
	By default, <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org">DokuWiki</a> does no URL rewriting, resulting in URLs like this:
</p>

<pre>
http://example.com/doku.php?id=page
</pre>

<p>
	These URLs are considered ugly and are not indexed well by some search engines.
</p>

<p>
	Rewriting URLs in Apache is done through the <code>mod_rewrite</code> module of <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html">Apache 1</a>
	or <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html">Apache 2</a>.
	The module is enabled in <code>httpd.conf</code> with the following line (make sure it is not commented out):
</p>

<pre>
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
</pre>

<p>
	On many kinds of Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, etc) you may enable <code>mod_rewrite</code> with:
</p>

<pre>
sudo a2enmod rewrite
</pre>

<p>
	The setup of module mod_rewrite is done through so-called <strong>rewrite rules</strong>,
	which can be either defined directly in the server's main config or in a <code>.htaccess</code> file located in DokuWiki's main directory.
	DokuWiki comes with an <code>.htaccess.dist</code> file which contains the needed rewrite rules for mode 1, but commented.
	Just copy the file to <code>.htaccess</code> (in the folder that contains <code>doku.php</code>, caveat Debian users) and uncomment the lines to enable rewriting.
</p>

<p>
	In Debian 6 at least you do not have to copy anything. <code>/usr/share/dokuwiki/.htaccess</code> links to <code>/etc/dokuwiki/htaccess</code>. So there is no caveat anymore.
</p>

<p><code>.htaccess</code></p>
<pre>
RewriteEngine on

RewriteBase /dokuwiki

RewriteRule ^_media/(.*)              lib/exe/fetch.php?media=$1  [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^_detail/(.*)             lib/exe/detail.php?media=$1  [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^_export/([^/]+)/(.*)     doku.php?do=export_$1&amp;id=$2  [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^$                        doku.php  [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}       !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}       !-d
RewriteRule (.*)                      doku.php?id=$1  [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^index.php$               doku.php
</pre>

<p>
	Remember to set following in the Configuration Manager <code>/start?do=admin&amp;page=config</code>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use nice URLs: <code>.htaccess</code></li>
	<li>Use slash as namespace separator in URLs [<strong>x</strong>]</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Otherwise rewrite rules will not be useful.
