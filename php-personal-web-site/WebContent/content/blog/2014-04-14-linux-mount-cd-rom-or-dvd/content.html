<p>
	Common CD mount points are <code>/cdrom</code> and <code>/mnt/cdrom</code> and common DVD mount points are <code>/dvdrom</code> and <code>/mnt/dvdrom</code>.
</p>

<p>
	If the mount point does not exist, create it:
</p>

<pre>
mkdir /mnt/cdrom
</pre>

<p>
	Mount it:
</p>

<pre>
mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
</pre>

<p>
	If you cannot mount because
</p>
<blockquote>
	the device is already mounted or directory busy
</blockquote>
<p>
	perhaps the mount point <code>/mnt/cdrom</code> is your current directory. You have to change the directory to somewhere else in order to be able to mount to it.
</p>

<h3>Unmount and eject</h3>

<p>
	Exit the directory <code>/mnt/cdrom</code> and execute:
</p>

<pre>
umount /mnt/cdrom
eject
</pre>

<p>
	Or simply run:
</p>

<pre>
eject
</pre>

<p>
	If you are unable to unmount your previously mounted CD-ROM, make sure that you are not in the directory where your CD-ROM is mounted or that some other application is not using it.
</p>

<p>
	If you are still having problems to unmount your CD-ROM medium you can use <code>fuser</code> command to kill all related processes using your device.
</p>

<pre>
fuser -mk /dev/hdc
eject
</pre>

<p>
	Never use the above command on devices mounted read/write unless you are sure what you are doing.
