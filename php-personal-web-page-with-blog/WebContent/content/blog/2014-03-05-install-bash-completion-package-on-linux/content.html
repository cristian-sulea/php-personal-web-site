<blockquote>programmable completion (autocomplete) for the bash shell</blockquote>

<p>
	<strong>bash-completion</strong> extends bash's standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines with just a few keystrokes.
	This project was conceived to produce programmable completion routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands,
	reducing the amount of typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
	The programmable completion feature in Bash permits typing a partial command, then pressing the <code>[Tab]</code> key to auto-complete the command sequence.
	If multiple completions are possible, then <code>[Tab]</code> lists them all.
