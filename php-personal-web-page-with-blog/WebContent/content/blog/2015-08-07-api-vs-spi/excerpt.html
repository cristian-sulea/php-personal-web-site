	<strong>API</strong> stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Application Programming Interface</a>, and is a mean for accessing a service/function provided by some kind of software or a platform.
	<strong>SPI</strong> stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface">Service Provider Interface</a>, and is way to inject, extend or alter the behavior for software or a platform.
	Put differently, the API tells you what a specific class/method does for you and the SPI tells you what you must do to conform.
