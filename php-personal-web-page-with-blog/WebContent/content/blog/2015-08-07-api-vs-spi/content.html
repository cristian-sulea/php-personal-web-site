	<strong>API</strong> stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Application Programming Interface</a>,
	and is a mean for accessing a service/function provided by some kind of software or a platform.
	<strong>API</strong> is normally target for clients to access a service and its has the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>API is a programmatic way of accessing a service to achieve a certain behavior or output.</li>
	<li>From API evolution point of view, addition is no problem at all for clients.</li>
	<li>But API's once utilized by clients it can not (and should not) be altered / deleted unless there are an appropriate communications, since its a complete degradation of the client expectation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<strong>SPI</strong> stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface">Service Provider Interface</a>,
	and is way to inject, extend or alter the behavior for software or a platform.
	<strong>SPI</strong> is targeted for providers and has the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>SPI is a way to extend / alter the behavior of a software or a platform (programmable vs. programmatic).</li>
	<li>SPI evolution is different that SPI evolution, in SPI removal is not an issue.</li>
	<li>Addition of SPI interfaces will cause problems and may break existing implementations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Put differently, the API tells you what a specific class/method does for you and the SPI tells you what you must do to conform.
	So:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>the <strong>API</strong> is the description of classes/interfaces/methods/... that you <strong>call and use</strong> to achieve a goal</li>
	<li>the <strong>SPI</strong> is the description of classes/interfaces/methods/... that you <strong>extend and implement</strong> to achieve a goal</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Usually API and SPI are separate.
	For example in JDBC the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/Driver.html">Driver</a> class is part of the SPI:
	if you simply want to use JDBC, you don't need to use it directly, but everyone who implements a JDBC driver must implement that class.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes they overlap, however.
	The <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html">Connection</a> interface is both SPI and API:
	you use it routinely when you use a JDBC driver and it needs to be implemented by the developer of the JDBC driver.
