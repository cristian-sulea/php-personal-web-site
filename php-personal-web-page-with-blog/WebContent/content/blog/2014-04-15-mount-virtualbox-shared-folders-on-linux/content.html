Define a shared folder:
<pre>
Temp
</pre>

Create a folder where the shared folder will be mounted:
<pre>
mkdir ~/Temp
</pre>

Mount it:
<pre>
mount -t vboxsf Temp ~/Temp
</pre>

<p>
	If you want to have it mount automatically upon each boot, put the mount command in <code>/etc/rc.local</code> (Debian based distro's),
	or whatever script is run at the end of the boot process. When you put the mount command in <code>/etc/rc.local</code>,
	so it's mounted at startup, you can't use the short notation for your home folder.
</p>

<p>
	During startup, everything is done through the root user, so using <code>~</code> for home, means it's the home folder of Root (<code>/root</code>).
	Change it to the full path.
</p>

For example:
<pre>
mount -t vboxsf Temp /home/&lt;username&gt;/Temp
</pre>
