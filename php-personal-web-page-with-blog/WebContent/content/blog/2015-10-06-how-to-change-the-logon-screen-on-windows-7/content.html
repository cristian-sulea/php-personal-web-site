<p>
	Windows 7 makes it possible to change the welcome screen that appears when you start your computer without any third-party software, but this setting is well hidden.

<h3>Enabling Custom Backgrounds</h3>

<p>
	This feature is disabled by default, so you'll have to enable it from the Registry Editor.
</p>

<p>
	Launch the Registry Editor and navigate to the following key:
</p>

<pre>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\Background
</pre>

<p>
	<a href="images/how-to-change-the-logon-screen-on-windows-7-1.png">
		<img src="images/how-to-change-the-logon-screen-on-windows-7-1.png" alt="How to Change the Logon Screen on Windows 7 (1)" />
	</a>
</p>

<p>
	You'll see an <code>DWORD</code> value named <code>OEMBackground</code>.
	If you don't see it, right-click in the right pane, point to the "New" submenu and create a new DWORD value with this name.
	Double-click the <code>OEMBackground</code> value and set its value to <code>1</code>.

<h3>Setting An Image</h3>

<p>
	Your image file must be less than <code>256 KB</code> in size.
	It's also a good idea to use an image file that matches the resolution of your monitor, so it won't look stretched.
	<br>
	Windows looks for the custom logon screen background image in the following directory:
</p>

<pre>
C:\Windows\System32\oobe\info\backgrounds
</pre>

<p>
	Copy your desired background image to the backgrounds folder and name it <code>backgroundDefault.jpg</code>.
</p>
