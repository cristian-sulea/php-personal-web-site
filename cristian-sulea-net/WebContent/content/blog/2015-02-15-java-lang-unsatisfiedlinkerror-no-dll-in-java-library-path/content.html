<p>
	The <code>UnsatisfiedLinkError</code> is thrown if the Java Virtual Machine cannot find an appropriate native-language definition of a method declared native.
</p>

<p>
	In order for <code>System.loadLibrary()</code> to work, the library (on Windows, a DLL) must be in a directory
	somewhere on your <code>PATH</code> or on a path listed in the <code>java.library.path</code> system property,
	so you can launch Java like:
</p>

<pre>
java -Djava.library.path=/path/to/dir
</pre>

<p>
	Additionally, for <code>loadLibrary()</code>, you specify the base name of the library, without the <code>.dll</code> at the end. So,
	for <code>/path/to/dir/foo.dll</code>, you would just use:
<p>

<pre>
System.loadLibrary(&quot;foo&quot;)
</pre>

<p>
	You also need to look at the exact UnsatisfiedLinkError that you are getting. If it says something like:
<p>

<blockquote>
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no foo in java.library.path
</blockquote>

<p>
	then it can't find the foo library (<code>foo.dll</code>) in your <code>PATH</code> or <code>java.library.path</code> specified at launch time.
</p>

<p>
	If it says something like:
</p>

<blockquote>
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: com.example.program.ClassName.foo()V
</blockquote>

<p>
	then something is wrong with the library itself in the sense that Java is not able to map a native Java function in your application to its actual native counterpart.
</p>

<p>
	To start with, I would put some logging around your <code>System.loadLibrary()</code> call to see if that executes properly.
	If it throws an exception or is not in a code path that is actually executed, then you will always get the latter type of <code>UnsatisfiedLinkError</code> explained above.
</p>

<p>
	As a side note, most people put their <code>loadLibrary()</code> calls into a static initializer block in the class with the native methods,
	to ensure that it is always executed exactly once:
<p>

<pre>
public class Foo {

    static {
        System.loadLibrary(&quot;foo&quot;);
    }

    public Foo() {}

}
</pre>
