<p>
	The solution to code repetition (like for example wiring an <code>id</code>, <code>version</code> and/or <code>timestamp</code> fields in every Hibernate entity) is to inherit
	these properties from a superclass. This can be done using the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/MappedSuperclass.html">@MappedSuperclass</a> annotation.
	A mapped superclass designates a class whose mapping information is applied to the entities that inherit from it.
